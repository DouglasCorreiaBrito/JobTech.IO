# JobTech.IO

This project is an initiative of a small group of developers to create an inverted vacancy system where the candidate can register his concept of a good vacancy (with salary, benefits, among others) and the company that is willing to hire him under those conditions can contact him

## Starting

These instructions will provide a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements

What you need to install the software and how to install it

`` ``
Apache Maven: http://maven.apache.org/
`` ``
`` ``
JDK 8 : https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html 
`` ``
`` ``
MySQL Community Server: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

### Installing

The project was created with Spring initializr (https://start.spring.io/) and to "install this project" it is enough that you acquire the source code (via git clone preferably) and import the Jobtech folder in your IDE as " Maven Project "

- You will need to pay attention to the application.properties file (found in path src / main / resources) to configure the access information for your database, example:

Connector and location of your database:
`` ``
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbjobtech?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
`` ``

Database access user and password:
`` ``
spring.datasource.username=my_user
spring.datasource.password=my_secret_password
`` ``

- Since you have already met the requirements and have a copy of the code with you, open the terminal in the project folder and type:
`` ``
mvn clean install spring-boot:run
`` ``
-If the project builds correctly, go to the browser and type http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html, you should see a page similar to the one below:
